# NCAA-Betting-Trends-Prediction

## Project Overview

This project examines historical betting trends in NCAA football games to predict outcomes and identify profitable betting strategies. By analyzing game betting percentages, odds, and game results over several seasons, the project aims to uncover significant patterns that can inform better betting decisions.

Objectives

Analyze Betting Trends: Identify patterns in betting percentages and odds that correlate with game outcomes.

Predictive Modeling: Develop predictive models to forecast game results based on historical betting trends.

Statistical Insights: Provide statistical analysis of game data to help bettors make informed betting decisions.

Data Sources

NCAA Football Betting Data: Historical betting percentages, odds, and game results for NCAA football games collected over several seasons.

## Methodology

## Data Cleaning and Transformation:

Managed missing or incorrect values, standardized data types, and created new features for analysis.

Filtered the dataset to focus on specific betting percentages and odds that were consistent across platforms.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized trends and patterns in betting percentages and odds over time.

Analyzed correlations between betting percentages, odds, and game results.

## Predictive Modeling:

Developed machine learning models to predict game outcomes using historical betting data.

Evaluated model accuracy using cross-validation and test sets.

## Visualization:

Created graphical representations of trends using ggplot2 and other visualization tools.

## Key Findings

##Betting Patterns:
Point Spread Betting: Point spread betting showed significant trends, where teams frequently beat the spread more often when they were underdogs compared to when they were favorites. This finding highlights a potential bias in bookmaker odds 
favoring well-known teams.

Over/Under Betting: The over/under betting patterns showed predictive potential as well, revealing that high-profile games often attract higher scores, resulting in more over bets winning. Anomalies were found where defensive teams consistently scored below the projected totals, presenting profitable opportunities.

Moneyline Trends: Moneyline bets demonstrated stronger profitability when predicting underdogs, indicating that markets often underestimate the winning chances of lesser-known teams.

## Model Performance:

The predictive models, based on machine learning algorithms, achieved significant accuracy levels in forecasting outcomes based on historical betting data. The models effectively utilized betting odds, spreads, and team rankings to deliver highly accurate predictions, especially when used for underdog outcomes.

## Strategic Insights:

Statistical analysis revealed strategic insights that can improve betting strategies. These include monitoring team injury reports, comparing historical performance against specific rivals, and observing last-minute betting shifts. The models also flagged games where betting percentages were unusually skewed, indicating potential market manipulation or insider information influencing the odds.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of NCAA football betting trends, demonstrating how betting percentages and odds can be used to predict game outcomes. The data-driven approach helped uncover profitable betting strategies, including:

Leveraging point spreads to identify teams that regularly beat the spread when underdogs.
Using over/under totals strategically by recognizing scoring patterns and defensive biases.
Applying machine learning models for accurate outcome predictions, primarily by analyzing moneyline trends.
These insights help bettors develop winning strategies that are based on statistical evidence rather than intuition. By identifying significant patterns and trends, this project helps bettors refine their strategies to improve long-term profitability.
